Write a program that receives a list of integer numbers (separated by a single space) and a number n. The number n
represents the count of numbers to remove from the list. You should remove the smallest ones, and then, you 
should print all the numbers that are left in the list, separated by a comma and a space ", ".

EXAMPLE

SOLUTION

numbers = list(map(int, input().split(" ")))
count_of_numbers_to_remove = int(input())
count_of_removed_numbers = 0

for i in range(len(numbers)):
    if count_of_removed_numbers == count_of_numbers_to_remove:
        break
    numbers.remove(min(numbers))
    count_of_removed_numbers += 1

string_numbers = ', '.join([str(el) for el in numbers])  #list comprehension
#numbers = ', '.join(map(str, numbers))  Second way with MAP

print(string_numbers)
