You want to go to France by train, and the train ticket costs exactly 150$. You do not have enough money, so you 
decide to buy some items with your budget and then sell them at a higher price – with a 40% markup.

You will receive a collection of items and a budget in the following format:
{type->price|type->price|type->price……|type->price}
{budget}

The prices for each of the types cannot exceed a specific price, which is given below:
Type       Maximum Price
Clothes       50.00
Shoes         35.00
Accessories   20.50

If a price for a particular item is higher than the maximum price, don't buy it. Every time you buy an item, you have 
to reduce the budget with its price value. If you don't have enough money for it, you can't buy it. Buy as many items 
as you can.

Next, you should increase the price of each item you have successfully bought by 40% and then sell it. Calculate if 
the budget after selling all the items is enough for buying the train ticket

Input / Constraints
• On the 1st line, you will receive the items with their prices in the format described above – real numbers in the 
range [0.00……1000.00]
• On the 2nd line, you are going to be given the budget – a real number in the range [0.0….1000.0]

Output
• First, print the list with the bought item’s new prices, formatted to the second decimal point in the following 
format:
"{price1} {price2} {price3} … {priceN}"
• Second, print the profit, formatted to the second decimal point in the following format:
"Profit: {profit}"
• Finally:
o If the budget is enough for buying the train ticket, print: "Hello, France!"
o Otherwise, print: "Not enough money."


EXAMPLE


SOLUTION

items = input().split("|")
budget = int(input())
initial_budget = budget
new_prices = []
for item in items:
    product, price = item.split("->")
    if (product == "Clothes" and float(price) <= 50) or (product == "Shoes" and float(price) <= 35) or (product == "Accessories" and float(price) <= 20.50):
        if budget >= float(price):
            budget -= float(price)
            new_prices.append(float(price)*0.40 + float(price))
spent_money = initial_budget - budget
budget_after_selling = spent_money*0.40 + spent_money + budget

print(' '.join([str(format(i, ".2f")) for i in new_prices]))
print(f"Profit: {spent_money*0.40:.2f}")
if budget_after_selling >= 150:
    print(f"Hello, France!")
else:
    print(f"Not enough money.")
