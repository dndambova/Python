PROBLEM

Write a program that keeps track of people getting water from a dispenser and the amount of water left at the end.

On the first line, you will receive the starting quantity of water (integer) in a dispenser. Then, on the following lines,
you will be given the names of some people who want to get water (each on a separate line) until you receive the command "Start". Add those people to a queue. 

Finally, you will receive some commands until the command "End":
- "{liters}" - litters (integer) that the current person in the queue wants to get. Check if there is enough water in the dispenser for that person.
o If there is enough water, print "{person_name} got water" and remove him/her from the queue.
o Otherwise, print "{person_name} must wait" and remove the person from the queue without reducing the water in the dispenser.
- "refill {liters}" - add the given litters in the dispenser.

In the end, print how many liters of water have left in the format: "{left_liters} liters left".

EXAMPLE

INPUT          OUTPUT

10             Peter got water    
Peter          George got water
George         Amy got water
Amy            Alice must wait
Alice          2 liters left
Start
2
3
3
3
End

SOLUTION

from collections import deque
quantity_of_water = int(input())
people = deque()
while True:
    name = input()
    if name == "Start":
        break
    people.append(name)
while True:
    cmd = input()
    if cmd == "End":
        break
    elif "refill" in cmd:
        ref, num = cmd.split(" ")
        quantity_of_water += int(num)
    else:
        if quantity_of_water >= int(cmd):
            print(f"{people.popleft()} got water")
            quantity_of_water -= int(cmd)
        else:
            print(f"{people.popleft()} must wait")
print(f"{quantity_of_water} liters left")
